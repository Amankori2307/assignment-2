Imagine that we have two components - ComponentA and ComponentB. Both components have to interact with each other in some way:
- Send some data from ComponentA to ComponentB and vice versa.

- Parent interacts with child using local variable
- Parent and children communicate using a service

**2) For each option describe what are the pros and cons of this solution?** <br/>

**3) For each option describe what are the cases the solution fits best?** <br/>
